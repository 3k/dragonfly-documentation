## Error Log

The Error Log is the place to track down syntax and parse errors that may be causing an application to behave unexpectedly.

Click on the Errors icon in the application toolbar to access the Error Log. Pages that contain errors will cause the icon to display a small number which indicates how many errors there are in the log.


###Search

To search through all errors on a page, use the Search control on the Error Log toolbar.

###Tabs

By default, the **All** tab will be selected, showing every type of error for the current page. Errors can be filtered by selecting a more specific tab, for example the **JavaScript** tab.

To add (or remove) tabs from the Error Log, select the appropriate checkbox from the Error Log tab of the Dragonfly Preferences.

Error messages can be opened one by one by clicking on them, or globally by clicking the **Expand All** icon in the Error Log toolbar.

###CSS Filters

Custom CSS filters can be defined to remove certain types of errors from the **All** and **CSS** tabs of the Error Log. For example, a filter like `*padding` will tell the Error log to ignore any IE6- or IE7-specific padding hacks.

###Clearing the Error Log

The Error Log is cleared by clicking the Trashcan icon in the toolbar.
